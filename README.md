# TripodPi

I was filming a dance retial on day, and I realized that the two main camera movements that I was constantly doing was panning and tilting. I thought to myself, "What if I just got two servos to do this for me. That way, I could sit back, relax, and control the tripod like I was playing a videogame."

There is a whole bunch of math that I did when I first started working on this, but I don't feel like getting into that now.

I want this repo here, because in the words of my favorite professor at college, "Your tripod is your best friend."
